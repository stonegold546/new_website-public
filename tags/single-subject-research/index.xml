      <description>Background I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in analysis of single case designs (SCD) using hierarchical models: each case is unique but we can improve estimation for each case by sharing data across cases. Given that data from SCD are often atypical, I&amp;rsquo;ve thought such data are a good candidate for ordinal regression.1
Broadly, we can model unidimensional2 continuous, count, ordinal data as ordinal, since these data are also ordinal. If we knew the exact distribution for the data, we could perform more efficient analyses, but we often don&amp;rsquo;t.</description>
