<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>For some time, I&rsquo;ve been interested in analysis of single case designs (SCD) using hierarchical models: each case is unique but we can improve estimation for each case by sharing data across cases. I also like Bayesian modeling. With Bayesian models, we try to encode as much of our knowledge of the data and parameters using likelihood and prior functions. Given that data from SCD are often atypical, I&rsquo;ve thought such data are a perfect candidate for ordinal regression.</p>
<p>Basically, we model seemingly continuous data as ordinal. Ordinal regression adequately describes the information in the data since univariate continuous data are also ordinal. Frank Harrell has pushed this type of model, and provides several resources <a href="https://www.fharrell.com/post/rpo/">here</a>. There are also useful papers: <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1016/j.sjpain.2016.06.012/html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28872693">here</a> and <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.2202/1557-4679.1230/html">here</a>, and I&rsquo;ve applied to same idea to analysis of sum scores of Likert-response scales <a href="https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.57610">here</a>.</p>
<p>So I did some work on ordinal hierarchical models for analysis of SCD some time back &ndash; time stamp on my laptop says January 2022!! This work never left my laptop, and I mentioned it in passing to maybe two people. I thought of reaching out to <a href="https://www.jepusto.com/">James Pustejovsky</a> to get his thoughts, but for some reason, I didn&rsquo;t follow through. Enter AERA 2024, I somehow found myself at a structured poster session for analysis of SCD. Very interesting work all around; count mixed models, model-based effect size estimation and benchmarks, single case mediation, &hellip; Made me want to share this again, and James P. encouraged me to send it his way. So here goes.</p>
<h2 id="description-of-hierarchical-ordinal-model">Description of hierarchical ordinal model</h2>
<ol>
<li>Case-specific trajectories: I assume each case has its own trajectory using B-splines (generic choice).</li>
<li>Case-specific treatment effects: I assume each case has its own treatment effect.</li>
</ol>
<p>I use hierarchical modelling to estimate both the trajectories and treatment effects.</p>
<p>At the moment, the idea is for analysis of simple designs: AB, ABAB, &hellip;</p>
<p>First step is to transform the data to ranks. Now some model details.</p>
<h3 id="threshold-estimation">Threshold estimation</h3>
<p>I model the ranks using ordinal regression, specifically cumulative logit with proportional odds assumed. I estimate the thresholds using I-splines (monotonic splines), because splines can approximate the thresholds with a fewer number of parameters. For example, if we have 85 unique outcome values, we can approximate the 84 thresholds using an 18-basis spline &ndash; great reduction in number of parameters. Also, the monotonicity of I-splines is necessary for estimating the ordinal thresholds.</p>
<h3 id="model">Model</h3>
<p>The model for the ranked data \(z_{tc}\) at time \(t\) for case \(c\) assuming \(J\) unique outcome values is:</p>
<p>\begin{split}
\text{Pr}&amp;(z_{tc} \le j) = \text{inv-logit}\Big(\alpha + \mathbf s_j^\prime \boldsymbol\lambda - \big(\beta_c\times treat_{tc} + \mathbf f_t^\prime\boldsymbol(\boldsymbol\gamma+\boldsymbol\delta_c)\big)\Big)\ \text{for } (j = 1, \dots, J-1),\newline
&amp;\alpha \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 2.5),\ \boldsymbol\lambda \sim \mathcal{N}^+(0, \sigma_\lambda),\ \beta_c \sim \mathcal{N}(b_0, \sigma_\beta),\ \boldsymbol\gamma \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_\gamma),\ \boldsymbol\delta_c \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_\delta)\newline
&amp;b_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_b),\ [\sigma_\lambda, \sigma_\beta, \sigma_\gamma, \sigma_\delta,\sigma_b] \sim t^+(3, 0, 1)
\end{split}</p>
<p>where \(\alpha\) is the intercept, \(\mathbf S\) is a \((J - 1) \times k\) I-spline where \(k\) is the number of basis functions. When \(k &lt; (J - 1)\), the spline approximates the thresholds. The spline weights, \(\boldsymbol\lambda\), are assumed half-normal. They are shrunken towards 0 with a scale \((\sigma_\lambda)\) that is learned from the data.</p>
<p>\(treat_{tc}\) is an indicator for treatment phase such that \(\beta_c\) is the case level treatment effect. This treatment effect is assumed normal across cases with grand mean, \(b_0\), and scale, \(\sigma_\beta\). Both parameters are themselves learned from the data. The grand-mean also has a ridge type penalty, with a scale that is learned from the data.</p>
<p>\(\mathbf F\) is the B-spline representing time. The weights are a combination of an overall time-trend, \(\boldsymbol\gamma\), and a case-specific deviation, \(\boldsymbol\delta_c\). Both the overall and case-specific deviations are learned from the data with ridge-type penalties.</p>
<p>When using ridge-type penalties, the scale parameters, \((\sigma_\lambda, \sigma_\beta, \sigma_\gamma, \sigma_\delta, \sigma_b)\), have weakly-informative half-\(t\) priors.</p>
<h3 id="effect-sizes">Effect sizes</h3>
<p>The ordinal logistic model above is one for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the ranks. From there, we compute the probability mass function (PMF). Given the PMF, one can then apply several of the equations listed in the <a href="https://jepusto.github.io/SingleCaseES/articles/Effect-size-definitions.html">documentation of the SingleCaseES package</a> to obtain effect sizes. I focus on the NAP, PEM and TAU (since it&rsquo;s just \(2\times\) NAP - 1). For effects defined on the original data scale like differences in means or medians, we can simply replace ranks with the original data to obtain results on the original data scale. For all effects, we can obtain credible intervals since we&rsquo;re making each computation within each iteration.</p>
<h3 id="some-features">Some features</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of regularization going on with the model. The goal is that case-specific estimates are shrunken towards each other, and the data are not so reactive to outlying data points. These features are passed on to the computed effect sizes. We&rsquo;ll see this below in the example I cover.</p>
<h3 id="logistics">Logistics</h3>
<p>I wrote some Stan code to fit the model above. The code is available on as a gist file:</p>

<p>The gist above contains a demonstration which I review next</p>
<h2 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h2>
<p>For demonstration, I use the <code>Schmidt2012</code> dataset in the <code>SingleCaseES</code> package: <code>SingleCaseES::Schmidt2012</code>. The data are from an ABAB design:</p>
